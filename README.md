### Hi there 👋
#### I'm HuffyPiet, long name Humphrey Pietersen

## Software Engineer (Web) / UX Researcher
---

Right from when I was first introduced to computers in the late 1990s I was very hooked but it would be until 2010, that I would own my first fully functional desktop PC. At the time graphics and motion design took my fansy. Then came the caveats of not being able to render animations or edit videos with very under-resourced MSI Desktop PC. 

To remediate this, I looked for gigs and also considered alternative career paths, going through other careers before finally, landing on the idea that , writing codes is what I could probably do. That I could write code efficiently, that emulates beautiful graphics. The works that could have strained my then existing PC, which required intensive graphics processing unit resources, to thrive as a professional, coding did not.

Today, I happy to have learnt to code albeit self-taught, I used a ton of help from the internet.

All that said, It's my hope you would find great value from connecting with me or forking my repos to contribute, or join me let's create value, together let's brighten the web and make it an awesome place to hang out.
