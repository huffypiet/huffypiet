Right from when I was first introduced to computers in the late 1990s I was very hooked but it would be until 2010, that I would own my first fully functional desktop PC. At the time graphics and motion design took my fansy. Then came the caveats of not being able to render animations or edit videos with very under-resourced MSI Desktop PC. 

To remediate this, I looked for gigs and considered alternative career path, going through other careers before landing on the idea, that I want to write code that emulates beautiful graphics. As opposed the previous career, that require intensive graphics processing unit resources, to thrive as a professional, coding did not.

Today, I happy to have learnt to code albeit self-taught, I used a lot of help from Youtube, Stackoverflow and CSSTricks, to inspire my projects.

At this juncture, you might have learnt that I took inspiration from many places. That is the way to do it, I realized that the best way to do it, was not always to feel anxious to copy source codes, but sometimes to just take the plunge. Take the plunge, go for adventures using the source codes you read as inspiration to build your own awesome projects. Of course you may not need to say anything about the source code but its good courtesy, to share where you drew your inspiration.

All that said, I wish you would find value within my experiment repositories, connect, contribute or collaborate with me on an code project that you may find I am working that takes your interest.
